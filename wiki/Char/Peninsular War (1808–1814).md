**The Peninsular War** (1808–1814) was a major conflict fought in the Iberian Peninsula, where Spain and Portugal, supported by Britain, resisted the invasion and occupation by Napoleonic France. The war began with the joint French and Spanish invasion of Portugal in 1807, but escalated in 1808 when France occupied Spain and Napoleon installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king. Most Spaniards rejected French rule, leading to widespread resistance and the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare.

The conflict saw significant battles, such as the Spanish victory at Bailén and the prolonged siege of Cádiz. British forces, led by Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), played a crucial role in defending Portugal and supporting Spanish resistance. The war drained French resources, especially after Napoleon diverted troops to the disastrous Russian campaign in 1812. Allied victories at Salamanca and Vitoria forced the French to retreat across the Pyrenees.

The Peninsular War weakened Napoleon’s empire and contributed to his eventual defeat. It also led to major political and social changes in Spain and Portugal, including the Spanish Constitution of 1812. However, the war left both countries devastated and set the stage for later civil conflicts and independence movements in Spanish America.

## 1807–1808: Invasion and Uprising

The Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 ended the War of the Fourth Coalition and left Napoleon free to pressure Portugal, Britain’s ally, to join his Continental System. When Portugal refused, France and Spain secretly agreed to divide the country. French troops under Junot, supported by Spanish forces, invaded Portugal in October 1807. The Portuguese royal family, aided by the British navy, fled to Brazil, leaving Lisbon to French occupation. The French imposed harsh taxes and seized property, causing widespread resentment among the Portuguese.

Meanwhile, Spain, though allied with France, was internally divided and unstable. The Spanish court was split between supporters of French influence and traditionalists. After the defeat at Trafalgar, Spain’s alliance with France weakened, and Napoleon began to distrust his Spanish partners. Spanish troops were sent to northern Europe, further straining the country.

In early 1808, French forces occupied key Spanish cities, claiming to be allies but arousing suspicion. Political turmoil erupted when King Charles IV abdicated in favor of his son Ferdinand VII after the Mutiny of Aranjuez. Napoleon summoned both to Bayonne, where he forced them to abdicate and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king.

On May 2, 1808, Madrid rose in revolt against French occupation, sparking widespread uprisings across Spain. The French responded with brutal repression, but resistance spread rapidly. Guerrilla warfare broke out, and the French found themselves fighting both regular armies and popular insurgents.

## British Intervention and Early Battles

Britain landed troops in Portugal in August 1808, led by Arthur Wellesley, and defeated the French at Roliça and Vimeiro. The controversial Convention of Cintra allowed the French to evacuate Portugal. British and Spanish forces coordinated efforts, and Spanish troops returned from northern Europe to join the fight.

French attempts to suppress the Spanish uprising met with mixed success. While they won some battles, such as Medina de Rioseco, they suffered a major defeat at Bailén, where an entire French corps surrendered. This was the first major defeat of Napoleon’s armies in open battle and forced the French to retreat behind the Ebro River.

Napoleon responded by leading a massive army into Spain in late 1808, quickly defeating Spanish forces and recapturing Madrid. British forces under Sir John Moore advanced into Spain but were forced to retreat to Corunna, where Moore was killed during the evacuation. Despite setbacks, Spanish resistance continued, and the French faced ongoing guerrilla attacks and difficulties controlling the country.

## 1809

In early 1809, the French besieged Zaragoza for a second time, committing large forces and artillery. The defenders, led by Palafox, resisted fiercely but eventually surrendered after heavy losses and devastation. The French did not advance beyond the Ebro River.

The Spanish Junta took charge of the war effort, raising taxes, forming new armies, and allying with Britain. Attempts to retake Madrid failed, with Spanish forces suffering heavy defeats at Uclés, Ciudad Real, and Medellín. However, Spanish troops achieved some local victories in Galicia, forcing the French to withdraw from the region by mid-1809.

In Catalonia, the French captured Girona after a long siege, but faced setbacks at Alcañiz before regaining the initiative at María and Belchite. Meanwhile, Marshal Soult invaded Portugal, capturing Porto after a bloody battle, but was soon expelled by British and Portuguese forces under Wellesley.

Wellesley then advanced into Spain, joining with Spanish forces for the Battle of Talavera. The Allies repelled French attacks but suffered heavy casualties and eventually withdrew to Portugal due to supply shortages and French reinforcements.

Later in 1809, the Spanish Junta launched a major offensive to recapture Madrid, but suffered disastrous defeats at Ocaña and Alba de Tormes. By the end of the year, French forces had regained the upper hand, and Spanish armies were left weakened and scattered.

</p>

In 1810, Joseph Bonaparte reorganized Spain into French-style provinces and prefectures, seeking to strengthen French control. Some elites cooperated, but most Spaniards resented the occupation, and support for the French was limited. The war saw the rise of large-scale guerrilla warfare, with irregular fighters harassing French troops and tying down large numbers of soldiers. While some guerrillas were motivated by patriotism, others sought personal gain or survival. The French viewed Spanish resistance as rooted in tradition and religion, while Spanish accounts often exaggerated guerrilla successes.

The French invaded Andalusia in January 1810, quickly overrunning most of the region except for Cádiz, which remained under Spanish and British control. The Spanish government fled to Cádiz, dissolved itself, and established a regency council, which later convened the Cortes of Cádiz to draft a new constitution. Cádiz, protected by strong fortifications and the British navy, withstood a prolonged French siege.

Meanwhile, Wellington anticipated a renewed French invasion of Portugal and ordered the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras—massive defensive works north of Lisbon. The surrounding countryside was stripped of resources to deny supplies to the enemy, and thousands of civilians were relocated behind the lines.

In the spring and summer, the French captured Ciudad Rodrigo and invaded Portugal with a large army under Marshal Masséna. After heavy fighting at Bussaco, Wellington retreated to the Lines of Torres Vedras. The French, unable to break through and suffering from shortages, eventually withdrew, marking a turning point in the Peninsular War.


## 1811–1812

During 1811, French forces were stretched thin as Marshal Soult besieged Badajoz, prompting the defenders of Cádiz to attempt a breakout with the arrival of an Anglo-Spanish relief army. Although the Allies won at Barrosa, they failed to capitalize on their success, and the French soon renewed the blockade. Soult captured Badajoz and Olivenza, taking thousands of prisoners, but had to redeploy due to threats elsewhere. Meanwhile, Masséna’s exhausted army retreated from Portugal, and Wellington went on the offensive, laying siege to Almeida and clashing with the French at Fuentes de Oñoro. The French eventually withdrew, and Wellington renewed the siege of Badajoz, but was forced to retreat when French reinforcements arrived.

In Catalonia and eastern Spain, the French captured key towns such as Tortosa and Tarragona, though Spanish guerrillas and counterattacks continued to challenge their control. Marshal Suchet’s campaigns secured Valencia, but the redeployment of French troops for the Russian campaign slowed further advances. By the end of 1811, the French were increasingly tied down by guerrilla warfare, with much of their army occupied in protecting supply lines.

In early 1812, Wellington renewed the Allied advance, capturing Ciudad Rodrigo and then Badajoz after bloody assaults. The Allies then took Salamanca and, after a decisive victory at the Battle of Salamanca, entered Madrid. The French were forced to abandon Andalusia and regroup in Valencia. However, Wellington’s attempt to capture Burgos failed, and a French counteroffensive forced the Allies to retreat to Portugal, suffering significant losses. Despite setbacks, the French grip on Spain was weakening, and the Allies had made substantial gains.

By 1813, Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign forced him to withdraw troops from Spain, weakening French control. The Allies, led by Wellington and composed of British, Spanish, and Portuguese forces, launched a major offensive. They defeated the French at the Battle of Vitoria, forcing them to retreat across the Pyrenees. The Allies continued their advance, overcoming French counterattacks and capturing key cities such as San Sebastián and Pamplona.

Crossing into France in late 1813, Wellington's army won further battles at the Bidassoa, Nivelle, and the Nive, steadily pushing the French back. The campaign was marked by harsh weather, supply shortages, and discipline problems among the troops, but the Allies maintained their momentum.

In early 1814, the final phase of the war unfolded on French soil. The Allies defeated the French at Orthez and fought a bloody battle at Toulouse in April. News soon arrived of Napoleon's abdication and the end of the war. The Peninsular War concluded with the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France and lasting changes for Spain and Portugal.
